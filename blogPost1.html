<h1 id="web-app-v-website">Web App v WebSite</h1>
<p>Prior to being introduced to many concepts of full stack development,
if I was asked to tell the difference between a website versus a web
application I would have just said they are the same. As the field of
web development continues to grow, a shift towards data driven
development has taken precedence over static site web development.</p>
<p>Being able to discern the difference between webapps and websites is
vital to modern web development. When it comes to deciding online
business solutions, being able to understand that the development
process for webapps is significantly different than the process needed
for websites. Understanding client needs and being able to identify what
kind of technologies needed for the job are fundamental to being a good
developer. For example if a client came asking for a portfolio site to
list information about themselves, I would argue that static site
generators would be the way to go. Some good static site generators to
use would be Hugo, Jekyll, and possibly wordpress depending on the
user’s experience level and need to modify content.</p>
<p>Websites described in today’s modern web development practices can be
described as a site that contains static content. Websites lack in being
able to provide robust interaction with an end user. But do strive when
it comes to displaying information to a user. For example websites are
great for building blog sites that strictly serve large amounts of text
and other various forms of content to a large user base. Websites also
perform well for businesses looking to showcase products. They excel in
building a brand image for businesses, which eventually lead to in
increase presence on the web</p>
<p>Webapps on the other hand differ from a website in the sense that
they are great for interacting with end users. Users are able to
interact with the page content and are able to manipulate data on the
page. An example of this would be the svelte store project located under
my projects section. The svelte store allows users to add and remove
content from a page, and manipulate price, description and item name.
This simple example is so fundamental to how we have been interacting
with websites. Amazon, one of the largest companies in the U.S. utilizes
this concept in their store where users are able to add and delete items
from a cart.</p>
<p>In today’s ever changing technological trends, it’s critical to be
able to adapt to new concepts and strategies to build web based services
that are both functional and efficient. New frameworks are always being
released, and can often offer better ways to develop either websites or
web apps. Svelte is a new JS framework that is modern and efficient in
generating web applications. On the other hand static site generators
like Hugo and Jekyll are great for building fast static websites.</p>
